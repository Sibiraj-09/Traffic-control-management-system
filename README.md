🚦 Traffic Control Management System
📌 Project Overview

  The Traffic Control Management System is a Java-based simulation project developed to demonstrate how software systems can help manage and control urban traffic efficiently.
  It simulates traffic signals, vehicle flow, and basic decision-making logic using Java AWT and Swing.
  
  This project is mainly intended for academic learning, mini projects, and smart traffic system demonstrations.

🎯 Objectives

  To simulate traffic signal operations
  
  To monitor and control vehicle flow
  
  To understand real-time traffic management concepts
  
  To demonstrate software-based traffic control logic

🛠️ Technologies Used

Programming Language: Java

GUI Framework: Java AWT & Swing

IDE: Eclipse / IntelliJ IDEA / NetBeans

Platform: Desktop Application

⚙️ Features

Login Page for user access

Dashboard for traffic monitoring

Traffic signal simulation (Red, Yellow, Green)

Vehicle count simulation

Route optimization logic (basic)

User-friendly graphical interface

🧠 Working Principle

The system simulates vehicles arriving at junctions

Vehicle count is calculated using predefined logic

Traffic signals change dynamically based on traffic load

Routes are optimized to reduce congestion

The dashboard displays real-time signal status

📊 Algorithms Used

Rule-Based Decision Algorithm for signal timing

Conditional Logic for route prioritization

Randomized Simulation Logic for vehicle count

⚠️ Note: This version uses simulated data, not real sensor input.
